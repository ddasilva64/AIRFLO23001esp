## Storytelling 

All dataset sources are licensed in the public domain, but **Adventure Works Cycles, Inc.**, and **AdventureWorksDW2022** are, both of them, fiction created by Microsoft Corp. It's a narrative to build project storytelling, containing data solutions, which is based on the author's experience or knowledge.  

**Disclaimer!**: **Adventure Works Cycles, Inc.** and **3DoWoCo** are fiction. Any similarities to companies living or dead, or something else is purely coincidental.

Many dataset sources are based on [**PROWPI001**](https://github.com/ddasilva64/MTDPDN23001esp/blob/master/proyectos/PROWPI001.ipynb) project, built by "Data Manipulation and Analysis with Pandas and Python" Platzi course. The **ETL** was made in this project using **Python**, but now we built the **ETL** with **PDI** exclusively.

The present project **PROWPI002** is an exercise for the "ETL with Python and Pentaho fundamentals" Platzi course.

Anyway, what can we get from data in this project? It can happen, as Forrest Gump said:  
> **_"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you gonna get."_**

That's all folks!!!
