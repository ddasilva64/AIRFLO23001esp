## Storytelling 

All dataset sources are licensed in the public domain, but **Adventure Works Cycles, Inc.**, and **AdventureWorksDW2022** are, both of them, fiction created by **_Microsoft Corp._** It's a narrative to build project storytelling, containing data solutions, which is based on the author's experience or knowledge.  

Many dataset sources are based on [**PROWPI001**](https://github.com/ddasilva64/MTDPDN23001esp/blob/master/proyectos/PROWPI001.ipynb) project, built by **_"Data Manipulation and Analysis with Pandas and Python" Platzi course_**. The **ETL** was made in this project using **_Python_**, but now we built the **_ETL_** with **_PDI_** exclusively.

The present project **_PROWPI002_** is an exercise for the **_"ETL with Python and Pentaho fundamentals" Platzi course_**.

Anyway, what can we get from data in this project? It can happen, as Forrest Gump said:  

> **_"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you gonna get."_**

That's all folks!!!
