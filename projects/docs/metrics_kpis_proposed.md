**_Warnings!_**: 

- In the **_DimPromotions_** table, there are 16 records:
1. 1 record (**_6.25%_**) corresponds to sales without discounts. All sales made to customers are without discounts. This is very concerning and indicates that **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** has not made any efforts to promote its sales to customers, while the competition continues to do so. The **_Board of Directors of Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. commits to exponentially increasing promotions to customers, especially in the ISS_** (International Sales Segment).
2. 13 records (**_81.25%_**) are related to resellers, and of these, 3 records (**_23.08%_**) correspond to promotions **_due to excess inventory_**. This is a serious mistake, as manufacturing to stock instead of on-demand increases expenses without boosting income. **_The Board of Directors of Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. commits to immediately designing a three-year plan to completely eliminate stock of their products and only manufacture on-demand_**, following a just-in-time approach.
- There is no relevant data related to promotions for customers, as the business is primarily oriented towards resellers. It is strongly advised that **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** changes its business model to increase sales to customers significantly, while still maintaining sales to resellers, especially through the **_ISS_**. The **_Board of Directors of Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. commits to designing a three-year plan to ensure that 80% of their customers are end consumers_**, which will require exploring new markets. Currently, sales are only made to **_UK, France, and Germany within the EU_**.
- We cannot make any assurances about customer retention since there have been no subscription sales in the **_ISS_** until now. As previously mentioned, the **_Board of Directors of Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. commits to changing the functioning of this subsystem_**.
- Due to the same reasons as with customer retention, we cannot determine if we are losing customers. **_We can only measure sales within a specific period_**.
