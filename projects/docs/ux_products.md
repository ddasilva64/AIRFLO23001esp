## Products  

**_Notices_**:  

In this section, we will present the metrics and KPIs related to products, guided by our previous research work. Our next step is to collaborate with **Adventure Works Cycles, Inc.** to finalize the UX for this topic section.

- We have obtained information related to sales to customers, but we also need to know what we sell to customers:
  - Number of products, quantity, price, and amount.
  - Category.
  - Subcategory.
  - Additionally, we need to relate all these data with the (analyzed) data of countries, regions, subregions, clients, etc.
- We have added a new report to the **BSC** to deal with the products.
- We will analyze Revenue By Product (**RBP**).

#### Europe

##### Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. Analysis

- **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** will consider all European countries except the three countries currently involved in the war, as previously mentioned.

- As previously mentioned, **_Revenue By Product_** represents the Price per Quantity minus Standard Cost (including Stocking cost).

##### Analysis Components

To analyze, we have:

1. List of sold products.
2. Products, quantities, net amounts in orders (remember that we obtained these by transforming sales in foreign currencies to USD).
3. Product slicer.
4. Category product slicer.
5. Subcategory product slicer.
