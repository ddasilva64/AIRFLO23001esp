## Metrics  

### **_Vanity metrics used by Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. in the ISS_**  

| Metric                | Meaning                                                                                                                              | 
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Social media follower | This vanity metric lacks depth, provides little substance, and minimal insight into a brand's real influence or engagement. The most meaningful social media metrics, like engagement rate and conversion rate, paint a clearer picture of genuine audience engagement. |
| Bounce rate           | It is the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing a single landing page. It doesn't provide context on how much time spent was truly valuable or how many people are taking action on the page. |
| Cost per view         | It reflects the cost of reaching each potential customer, but it doesn't account for whether those viewers actually engage with the content. |
| Keyword rankings (without context) | These rankings don't offer the bigger picture in any kind of meaningful way. |
