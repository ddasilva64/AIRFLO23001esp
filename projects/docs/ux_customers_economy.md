##### Important Notices and Information

**_Notices:_**

- **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** will consider all European countries, except the three countries currently involved in the war, as previously stated.
- As mentioned earlier (see [PROWPI001 metadata](prowpi001_Metadata.md)):
1. The **_Gross Domestic Product (GDP)_** represents private consumption plus gross private investment plus government investment plus government spending plus the difference between exports and imports for each country. The **_Gross Domestic Product Growth (GDPG)_** represents the difference between the current year's **_GDP_** and the previous year's **_GDP_** divided by the previous year's **_GDP_** for each country. Remember that we do not consider inflation, following the **_ceteris paribus_** hypothesis.
2. The **_Gross National Income Per Capita (GNIPC)_** represents **_GDP_** plus the difference between inward remittances by businesses and individuals and outward remittances by foreigners residing in the country divided by the population for each country.
3. The **_Public Debt as % of GDP (PDPGDP)_** represents the public debt divided by **_GDP_** at the end of a 12-month period for each country.
- **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** states the following:
1. It is impossible for countries to pay off the world public debt. **_Public debt limits economic growth_**.
2. The efforts of the FED and BCE against inflation are ABSOLUTELY INEFFICIENT because current inflation results from supply chain issues, not an overheating economy. **_Additive manufacturing largely mitigates supply chain problems_**.
3. While Bitcoin fights against inflation, the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), like the electronic Euro, generates public control and threatens economic liberty. **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. will support, to the extent possible, Bitcoin transactions and Smart Contracts_**.
4. Changes due to Artificial Intelligence will result in global unemployment but also present remarkable opportunities for business. **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. will create an AI business unit and offer pay-as-you-go services to individuals and businesses_**.
- **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** is committed to creating a new economy around its products and services, such as reselling or introducing new complementary offerings. This can help individuals build wealth and earn a living.
- In their three-year plan, **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** will develop these new opportunities for all people.
- **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** aims to become a leading industry that generates economic and social growth.
- In the case of **_GDPG_**, the current European market has an average of (7.44 + 6.96 + 2.89) / 3 ~ 5.77%, whereas the new European Market average is 6.49%. This indicates that **_GDPG is similar across all European countries_**.
- In the case of **_GNIPC_**, the total for the current European market is $145,696.04, while the new European Market is $1,170,129.19. This results in a ratio of $1,170,129.19 / $145,696.04 = 8.031304007988137 ~ 8.03.
- The population ratio calculated earlier (see [UX Customers Demography](ux_customers_demography.md)) was ~ 2.52, while the **_GNIPC_** ratio is ~ 8.03. This indicates that many European countries have a **_GNIPC_** greater than what we initially expected.
- In the case of **_PDPGDP_**, the current European market has a total of (112.58 + 95.35 + 69.64) / 3 = 92.52333333333333 ~ 92.52%, while the new European Market is 68.53%. This implies that many European countries have a low **_PDPGDP_**, but some countries have higher values. **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** considers an acceptable **_PDPGDP_** threshold to be 80%. If any country's **_PDPGDP_** exceeds this threshold, **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** will not collaborate with public companies or governments (local or national). In 2021, the following countries were in unfavorable positions:

1. Greece
2. Italy
3. Portugal
4. Spain
5. France
6. Belgium
7. UK
8. San Marino
