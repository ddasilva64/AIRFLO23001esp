**_Notice_**: **_ERD_** (Entity Relationship Diagram) is the best system to know the database design at a glance 

**_Warning_**!: Remember that field names are standard (the first character of the word is uppercase, and no spaces between words). That means that in the output table name and table field names (in **_PDI_**), we need to write them (table and fields) in double quotes

**_Notice_**: **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** has decided that multilingual capabilities into the DB (in general) are pointless. In addition, specifically for **_DS_**, and **_BI_**, since the users are internal and at managerial level, they must have worldwide pro knowledge of English. Also, binary picture fields are deprecated in DB
