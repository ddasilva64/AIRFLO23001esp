## Metrics  

### **_Actionable metrics that could be used by Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. in the ISS, but for which we do not have data available in PROWPI002_**  

| Metric                | Meaning                                                                                                                              |

| Engagement rate       | It is a measure of how much of our audience actively engages with our content. |
| Conversion rate       | It measures the number of users who converted as a percentage of the total number of users that visited our site. |
| User engagement       | It is not just the quantity of page views, but the quality of interaction they reflect. |
| Click-through rates   | It can be used to gauge how well our keywords and ads, and free listings, are performing. CTR is the number of clicks that our ad receives divided by the number of times our ad is shown: clicks / impressions = CTR. |
| Cost per click        | It is a metric that determines how much advertisers pay for the ads they place on websites or social media, based on the number of clicks the ad receives. |
| Keyword rankings (with context) | To make sense of this data, we need a better understanding of how many new customers were gained, how much relevant traffic was generated, or how much total sales increased due to the high-ranking keyword. |

**_Note_**: It may be that in the near future **_3DoWoCo_** could help **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** succeed in the **_ISS_** with these metrics.

### **_Actionable metrics that can be used by Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. in the ISS, and for which we do have data available in PROWPI002_**  

| Metric          | Meaning              | Possible findings |
| :-------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- |
| **_Customer lifetime value (LTV)_** | It is the average amount of money your company makes from a buyer for however long they stay a customer (months or years). It tells us whether we are spending too much or too little on acquiring customers. We can segment our customers by the average LTV. If we knew the **_CAC (customer Acquisition Cost)_**, then we could compare with the optimal level of 3:1 | If they unsubscribe, do they buy less or buy fewer add-ons? |
| **_Average revenue per account (ARPA)_** | It is the mean amount of revenue from a single customer. Companies typically calculate it per month or year, depending on their business model. ARPA = Total revenue / Total active accounts in period | **_Comparison_**: to assess a company's performance against its competitors or its own performance over time. **_Customer segmentation_**: to identify the most profitable customers. **_Product/Service segmentation_**: to determine which products or services generate the most revenue. **_Forecasting revenue_**: used to calculate a company's recurring income.|
| **_Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)_** | It tracks the total predictable revenue our company expects to make each month. There are two ways to calculate **_MRR_**: add up the monthly revenue we are bringing in from each customer for the total **_MRR_**, or multiply **_ARPA_** by our number of paying customers  | It reflects growth and helps us forecast future revenue| 
| **_New MRR_** | It refers to revenue from new customers | |
| **_Expansion MRR_** | It is revenue generated from existing customers, including cross-sells (buying complementary products or services), upgrades/upsells (a more expensive plan), and greater volume | It is considered the "holy grail" of **_MRR_**. Why? It's commonly known that retaining an existing customer is 5 to 25 times less expensive than acquiring a new one. Plus, customers are far less likely to churn when they've invested more in our product/service |
| **_Churn MRR_** | It is the revenue we have lost from customers who have downgraded their plans or canceled altogether | It is a leading indicator of next month's **_MRR_** |
| **_Annual recurring revenue (ARR)_** | It is our **_MRR_** multiplied by 12 or the recurring revenue we will generate in a calendar year | It has a significant advantage over **_MRR_**. Because salespeople typically sell more during longer months (like March, August, and December) and sell less during shorter months (like February, June, and April), your predicted **_MRR_** might be off from month to month. Since ARR applies to the entire year, monthly variance has no impact. While **_MRR_** tells you how your business is doing monthly, ARR gives you a yearly picture |
| **_Revenue churn_** | No matter what, churn is bad. However, revenue churn is different from customer churn. Revenue churn is the amount of revenue we have lost (aka **_churn MRR_**), while customer churn is the number of customers we have lost | From a business standpoint, it's probably preferable to lose three customers, each paying low per month, than one customer paying high per month |
|  **_Negative churn_** | It means our **_expansion MRR_** exceeds your **_churn MRR_** | If we can achieve negative churn, our business will grow exponentially |
