#### Exploring Country Data in GeoVisual

When using GeoVisual, you can explore country-specific information and metrics in a convenient way. Here's how it works:

- If you select a country in the countries slicer or click on a country region (for instance, Germany), you will see this country reflected in our **_BSC_** (Balanced Scorecard).
- Additionally, you can access tooltip text that provides key metrics such as **_LTV_** (Customer Lifetime Value), **_LTV/CAC_** (LTV to Customer Acquisition Cost ratio), and **_indicators_**.

#### Exploring States and Provinces in GeoVisual

When utilizing GeoVisual, you can delve deeper into geographical information by performing a **_drill-down_**. Here's how it works:

- If you perform a **_drill-down_**, you will uncover the states (or provinces in other countries) where **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** has made sales. This provides insight into the regional distribution of sales.
- Furthermore, during this drill-down, you will receive tooltip text containing pertinent information for each state or province.
