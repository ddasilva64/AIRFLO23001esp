### Geography

- Germany
- France
- Netherlands
- Belgium
- Austria
- Switzerland
- Luxembourg
- Monaco
- Liechtenstein

If you select a country in the countries slicer or click on a country region (for instance, Germany), you will see this country in our **_BSC_**. Additionally, you can access tip text with metrics such as **_LTV_**, **_LTV/CAC_**, and **_indicator_**.

On the other hand, if you perform a **_drill-down_**, you will see the states (or provinces in other countries) where **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** had any sales. Similarly, you will receive a tip text with relevant information for each state or province.

Anyway, at any moment, you can select a single customer, and all **_BSC_** information adapts to him/her.

By the way, until now, we had data; now we have information, and **_you will gain knowledge about the company to make performance decisions_**. **_That is the reason for our work_**.
