### Demography

#### Europe

**_Warnings!_**: 

- Today, Europe is at war again. There are three countries involved: the Russian Federation, Belarus, and Ukraine.
- The total population of Europe (excluding countries at war) is 548,836,669 people.
- The current **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** market in Europe has a population of 217,896,925 people.
- **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** decides to expand markets to all the countries of Europe (except for the three countries indicated before).
- **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** decides to adopt additive manufacturing for 100% of its products in a three-year plan.
- This will make it possible to manufacture according to the needs of very few people or just one, absolutely placing the customer at the center.
- These measures will make marginal costs and fixed costs such as storage disappear.
- As already mentioned, a usage and subscription spending model will be implemented that will eliminate the need for structural costs of the sales subsystem. These new business models should account for 80% of the business in the 3 years indicated.
- Finally, it is decided that **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** must be a data-driven company and must have software at its core.

Atending to population (only) we have: 

548,836,669 / 217,896,925 = 2.518790336302359 ~ 2.52
