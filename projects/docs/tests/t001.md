## DWH test #001   

### **_Cases_**:

- **_ETL mismatch 01_**: We forgot to create the metadata corresponding to this field. Need to repeat **_ETL_**, but with another name because trazabily  
- **_ETL mismatch 02_**: We do not was removed a deprecated field in the final layout. Need to repeat **_ETL_**, but with another name because trazabily   
- **_DWH mismatch 01_**: The metadata value was inserted into the metadata table at **_DWH_**, but the **_Comment_** property was not updated. We just need to update field property in **_DWH_**, because that was an oversight. No need to repeat **_ETL_**
