## Test #006-0 (initial checking)  

**_Notice_**: All the data that we collect for the **_Integrity_** and **_Quality_** tests are results that we have been obtaining in our **_ETL_** processes. The only thing we will do is show that the results obtained meet these criteria  

As we have done our job well, we only have to show the results of the tests that we have been doing  

If, despite everything, we miss a bug, we will detect it in the **_BSC_**. In that case, we will return to the corresponding **_ETL_** to fix the bug
