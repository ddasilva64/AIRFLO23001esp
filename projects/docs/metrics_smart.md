## Metrics  

### **_SMART metrics (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound)_**  

1. **_Specific_**: The goal should be precisely **_quantifiable as a number_**. For instance, **_the specific goal for the sales team would be the "sales target"_**.  

2. **_Measurable_**: The goal achievement should be measurable so that it will be possible for the managers to measure **_how much of the goal the team has completed_**. For instance, **_the "sales target" metric can be measured by comparing the current sales numbers against the ones in the previous review period_**.  

3. **_Achievable_**: While pushing the limits and going farther every time is indispensable for successful goal-setting and achievement, **_targets should be achievable_** at the same time. For instance, **_the goal connected to the "sales target" metric has to be set based on the past performance of the individuals and the team, while increasing it in line with the business goals_**.  

4. **_Relevant_**: The goal connected to the **_SMART metric should be aligned with the organization's objectives_**. For instance, **_if our organization's objective is to achieve a % YoY (year-over-year) increase in "sales growth", then the "sales target" should be relevant to the organization's objective and should be increased to similar levels accordingly_**.  

5. **_Time-bound_**: The goal should be completed within a predefined timespan, and achievements should be **_measured only within that time period_**. For instance, **_the year on year "sales growth" is expected to be a %, the "sales target" should be measured at the same % for the year (not beyond)_**.
