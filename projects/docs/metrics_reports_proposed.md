## Metrics  

### **_Reports proposed into BSC_**  

| Report                           | Meaning                                                                                        | Metrics                                                                                              |

| **_Sales management_**           | Sales managers must know how the sales process is trending.                                    | We track the value of new opportunities compared to the previous month or quarter, the weighted value of our pipeline, total sales versus our target, and/or close rate. |


**_Notice!_**: Until now, sales from representatives were made over the Internet, with representative ID. From now on, the **_Board of Directors_** of **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** has decided that **_ISS_** sales will only refer to sales that are made without the intervention of any representative. Therefore, metrics like Sales performance by rep or Sales management do not make sense for the **_ISS_** process anymore.
