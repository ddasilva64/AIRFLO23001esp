## Executive Summary

### **_Value Proposition_**

#### **_Return on Investment (ROI) of the Proposed Solution_**

- We calculate the profit with **_cost/hour of development_** in the two systems. **_Errors_** are valued as a **_factor of 2.5 over the above_**.
- **_ROI_** is calculated by **_comparing the profit and the cost of the new system_** (our **_ETL_** solution in **_PDI_**, and **_Python_**).

#### **_The Improved Service Delivery and Customer Experience_**

Competence in this business model is very hard, which is why **_our client needs very agile decision-making systems_**.

To avoid confusion, **_this system will not have as its objective_**:

- **_Be the basis of presentations_**
- **_Be an automated system to generate reports_**

Although, the above may be a secondary objective.
