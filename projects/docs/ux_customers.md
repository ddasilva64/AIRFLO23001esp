## Customers  

**_Notice:_** In this section, we will present the metrics and KPIs related to customers, guided by our previous research work. Our next step is to collaborate with **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** to finalize the UX for this topic section.

**_Warnings:_** 
- Remember that our hypothesis is **_"ceteris paribus"_**, meaning that we applied the forecast factor to extended amounts and quantities but not to costs. Hence, **_net income is not net income multiplied by the factor_**. Additionally, **_we used only 2013 orders_**.
- Furthermore, **_some customers bought in more than one currency_**, for instance, when they traveled to another country.
