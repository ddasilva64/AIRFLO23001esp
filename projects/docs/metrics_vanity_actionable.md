## Metrics  

### **_Vanity metrics and Actionable metrics_**  

**_Vanity metrics_** (the opposite of actionable metrics) are metrics that make us look good to others but **_do not help us understand our own performance in a way that informs future strategies_**. Any metric can be a vanity metric.  

**_Actionable metrics_** (the opposite of vanity metrics) are metrics that **_help us make decisions and aid our business in reaching its goals or growing_**. See **_SMART_** metrics.  

&nbsp;  

### **_How to identify vanity metrics_**  

1. What **_business decision_** can we make with the metric?  
2. What can we do to intentionally **_reproduce the result_**?  
3. Is the data a real **_reflection of the truth_**?
