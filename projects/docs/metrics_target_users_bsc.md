## Metrics  

### **_Target users of the BSC_**  

- **_Company Board of Directors_**: All. Deployed in **_PROWPI002_**.    
- **_Regional Sales Directors_**: Their view and the company's overview (**_RLS_**). Not deployed in **_PROWPI002_**.  

**_Note_**: **_Row-level security (RLS)_** within **_PBI_** can be used to restrict data access for given users. Filters restrict data access at the row level, and we can define filters within roles.  

**_Notice_**: **_RLS_** will be deployed in future deployments, but not in **_PROWPI002_**.
