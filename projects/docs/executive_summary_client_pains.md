## Executive Summary

### **_Client Pains_**

1. The problem with **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** is that its **_legacy system_** (which cannot, and should not be changed) works perfectly for the purpose it was implemented. The system is built on the following tech stack:

   - **_C#_**
   - **_SQL Server_**, not always with normalized tables (because they're inherited from other **_non-RDBMS_**)
   - **_Batch processes_** for obtaining and disseminating information via **_email_**
   - The **_IT (Information Technology)_** staff of our client is very busy with the classic **_Transactional System_**, and cannot respond to **_BI_** and **_DS_** needs.

2. Additionally, their system has the following gaps:

   - The **_creation of tables and views is chaotic_** (names, locations, etc.). **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** is actively fighting against this.
   - **_SQL quickly tends to become complicated and difficult to maintain_**. Also, the volatility of the IT staff makes the database very difficult to maintain. **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** is also actively fighting against this.
   - The **_creation of automated systems_**, despite having a batch process standard, has proven to be **_inefficient in meeting the needs of DS_**.
   - The **_IT_** staff is very professional and efficient, but they are **_too specialized_** in their technology stack.
   - The management staff of our client **_do not have the necessary skills_** to face **_BI_** and **_DS_** projects. To solve this problem, we have contacted **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** with our training partner: [**_Platzi_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platzi) (**_One of the best Technology of Information Systems Training companies worldwide_**).
