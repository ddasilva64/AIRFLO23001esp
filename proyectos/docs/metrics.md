## Metrics  

**_Notice!_**: **_PROWPI02_** only will get **_actionable metrics_**, but not **_vanity metrics_** or simple reports or presentations  

A simple quote:

> I have been struck again and again by how important measurement is to improving the human condition  
>(Bill Gates)

### **_Vanity metrics and Actionable metrics_**  

**_Vanity metrics_** (the opposite of actionable metrics), are metrics that make we look good to others but **_do not help we understand our own performance in a way that informs future strategies_**. Any metric can be a vanity metric  

**_Actionable metrics_** (the opposite of vanity metrics), are metrics that **_helps we make decisions and helps our business reach its goals or grow_**. See SMART metrics  

### **_How to identify vanity metrics_**  

1. What **_business decision_** can we make with the metric?  
2. What can we do to intentionally **_reproduce the result_**?  
3. Is the data a real **_reflection of the truth_**?  

### **_SMART metrics (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound)_**  

1. **_Specific_**: The goal should be precisely **_quantifiable as a number_**. For instance, **_the specific goal for the sales team would be  the "sales target"_**  

2. **_Measurable_**: The goal achievement should be measurable so that it will be possible for the managers to measure **_how much of the goal the team has completed_**. For instance, **_the "sales target" metric can be measured by comparing the current sales numbers against the ones in the previous review period_**  

3. **_Achievable_**: While pushing the limits and going farther every time is indispensable for successful goal-setting and achievement, **_targets should be achievable_** at the same time.  For instance, **_the goal connected to the "sales target" metric has to be set based on the past performance of the individuals and the team, while increasing it in line with the business goals_**  

4. **_Relevant_**: The goal connected to the **_SMART metric should be aligned with the organization's objectives_**. For instance,**_ if our organization's objective is to achieve a % YoY (year-over-year) increase in "sales growth", then the "sales target" should be relevant to the organization's objective and should be increased to similar levels accordingly_**  

5. **_Time-bound_**: The goal should be completed within a predefined timespan and achievements should be **_measured only within that time period_**. For instance, **_the year on year "sales growth" is expected to be a %, the "sales target" should be measured at the same % for the year (not beyond)_**

### **_Vanity metrics used by Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. in the ISS_**  

| Metric  | Meaning                                 | 
| :------ | :-------------------------------------- | 
| Social media follower | This vanity metric lacks depth, provides little substance, and minimal insight into a brand's real influence or engagement. The most meaningful social media metrics, like engagement rate and conversion rate, are a clearer picture of genuine audience engagement |
| Bounce rate | It is the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing a single landing page. It doesn't provide context on how much time spent was truly valuable or how many people are taking action on the page |
| Cost per view | It reflects the cost of reaching each potential customer, but it doesn't account for whether those viewers actually engage with the content |
| Keyword rankings (without context) | These rankings don't offer the bigger picture in any kind of meaningful way |

<p><br></p>

### **_Actionable metrics that could be used by Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. in the ISS, but for which we do not have data available in PROWPI002_**  

| Metric          | Meaning                                 | 
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- | 
| Engagement rate | It is a measure of how much of our audience actively engages with our content |
| Conversion rate | It measures the number of users who converted as a percentage of the total number of users that visited our site |
| User engagement | It is not just the quantity of page views, but the quality of interaction they reflect |
| Click-through rates | It can be used to gauge how well our keywords and ads, and free listings, are performing. CTR is the number of clicks that our ad receives divided by the number of times our ad is shown: clicks / impressions = CTR |
| Cost per click      | It is a metric that determines how much advertisers pay for the ads they place on websites or social media, based on the number of clicks the ad receives |
| Keyword rankings (with context) | To make sense of this data, we need a better understanding of how many new customers were gained, how much relevant traffic was generated, or how much total sales increased due to the high-ranking keyword |

**_Note_**: It may be that in the near future **_3DoWoCo_** could help **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** succeed in the ISS with these metrics

### **_Actionable metrics that can be used by Adventure Works Cycles, Inc. in the ISS, and for which we do have data available in PROWPI002_**  

| Metric          | Meaning              | Possible findings |
| :-------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- |
| **_Customer lifetime value (LTV)_** | It is the average amount of money your company makes from a buyer for however long they stay a customer (months or years). It tells us whether we are spending too much or too little on acquiring customers. We can segment our customers by the average LTV. If we knew the CAC (customer acquisition cost), then we could compare with the optimal level of 3:1 | If they unsubscribe, do they buy less or buy fewer add-ons? |
| **_Average revenue per account (ARPA)_** | It is the mean amount of revenue from a single customer. Companies typically calculate it per month or year, depending on their business model | |
| **_Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)_** | It tracks the total predictable revenue our company expects to make each month. There are two ways to calculate MRR: add up the monthly revenue we are bringing in from each customer for the total MRR, or multiply ARPA by our number of paying customers  | It reflects growth and helps us forecast future revenue| 
| **_New MRR_** | It refers to revenue from new customers | |
| **_Expansion MRR_** | It is revenue generated from existing customers, including cross-sells (buying complementary products or services), upgrades/upsells (a more expensive plan), and greater volume | It is considered the "holy grail" of MRR. Why? It's commonly known that retaining an existing customer is 5 to 25 times less expensive than acquiring a new one. Plus, customers are far less likely to churn when they've invested more in our product/service |
| **_Churn MRR_** | It is the revenue we have lost from customers who have downgraded their plans or canceled altogether | It is a leading indicator of next month's MRR |
| **_Annual recurring revenue (ARR)_** | It is our MRR multiplied by 12 or the recurring revenue we will generate in a calendar year | It has a significant advantage over MRR. Because salespeople typically sell more during longer months (like March, August, and December) and sell less during shorter months (like February, June, and April), your predicted MRR might be off from month to month. Since ARR applies to the entire year, monthly variance has no impact. While MRR tells you how your business is doing monthly, ARR gives you a yearly picture |
| **_Revenue churn_** | No matter what, churn is bad. However, revenue churn is different from customer churn. Revenue churn is the amount of revenue we have lost (aka churn MRR), while customer churn is the number of customers we have lost | From a business standpoint, it's probably preferable to lose three customers, each paying low per month, than one customer paying high per month |
|  **_Negative churn_** | It means our expansion MRR exceeds your churn MRR | If we can achieve negative churn, our business will grow exponentially |

| :-------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- |
| **_Sales performance by rep_** | It creates friendly competition by publicly tracking how each salesperson is performing | We pick our sales metrics based on the behavior we want to promote; for example, if we are trying to increase our team’s real sales efforts, we might display total sales by rep |
| **_Sales management_** | Sales managers must know how the team is trending | We track the value of new opportunities compared to the previous month or quarter, the weighted value of our pipeline, total sales versus our target, and/or close rate by the salesperson |

### **_KPIs proposed into BSC_**
