# Data Warehousing - eng -

> It is a **process**, not a product, for **collecting and managing data** from **various sources** in order to **obtain a unique and detailed view of a part or the entire company**.  
> [Devlin, 2011]  

## Data Warehouse (DWH)

- Is the **database** containing **data from various sources** is the **central repository**.
- Reports created from a **_DWH_** are used in **_BI_** (for example). In other words, **it is the data source container for BI solutions**.

## Data Mart (DM)

- **_DWH_** oriented towards a **specific area of the business**.
- They contain **summarized data for analysis in a unit of the organization**.

## DB OLTP vs. OLAP

### OLTP (OnLine Transaction Processing)

**_OLTP_** is the acronym for Online Transaction Processing. It is a type of processing that facilitates and manages transactional applications, usually for data input and retrieval, as well as transaction processing (transaction manager). **_OLTP_** software packages are based on client-server architecture since they are commonly used by companies with a distributed computer network. ([Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLTP)).

### OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing)

**_OLAP_** is the acronym for Online Analytical Processing (**_BI_**), which aims to streamline the querying of large amounts of data. It uses various data structures, typically multidimensional (or **_OLAP Cubes_**), containing summarized data from large databases or Transactional Systems (**_OLTP_**). It is used in business reports for sales, marketing, management reports, data mining, and similar areas. ([Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP)).

## DWH methodologies

### Bill Inmon

- **_Bill Inmon_**: **_William H. Inmon_** (born in 1945) is an American computer scientist, **_widely recognized as the father of DWH_**. He wrote the first book, conducted the first conference (with Arnie Barnett), wrote the first column in a magazine, and was the first to offer classes on **_DWH_**. He created the accepted definition of what a **_DWH_** is: a time-variant, integrated, non-volatile collection of data oriented toward management decisions. Compared to the approach of the other pioneering **_DWH_** architect, **_Ralph Kimball_**, **_Inmon_**'s approach is often characterized as a **top-down approach**. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Inmon)).

- **_Ralph Kimball_**: **_Ralph Kimball_** (born on July 18, 1944) is an author in the field of **_DWH_** and **_BI_**. He is one of the original architects of Data Warehousing and is known for his long-standing beliefs that **_DWH_** should be designed to be understandable and fast. His **bottom-up methodology**, also known as Dimensional Modeling or the Kimball methodology, is one of the two major Data Warehousing methodologies along with **_Bill Inmon_**. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kimball)).

## Some of the worst practices in Data Warehousing

1. **Thinking with an OLTP mindset when designing Data Warehousing**.
    - **Neglecting the Staging area** in our **_DWH_**, without any particular reason.
    - **Neglecting the Data Mart area** in our **_DWH_**, without any particular reason.

2. **Building the physical model of a DWH only with an OLAP DB, and not an OLTP DB**.

3. **Building the logical model of a DWH with an ER model, and not a DDM**.

4. **Improvising**, without having a **_DWH_** methodology.

5. Not being aware of the **effects of the chosen** **_DWH_** **methodology**.

6. **Allowing Directors or Business Managers to decide the configuration of our DWH (prioritizing their departmental interests)**.

7. **Going directly to the DDM solution without considering the raw data phase**.

8. **Confusing the DWH with a traditional OLTP DB**.

9. **Considering the DWH unnecessary**.
    - Not using the **_DWH_** because people think it's unnecessary.
    - Skipping the **_DWH_** and going straight to designing the **_DDM_** in the **_BI_** solution.
