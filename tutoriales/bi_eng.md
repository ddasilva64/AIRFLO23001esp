# Business Intelligence (BI) - eng -

## Today

Today in organizations worldwide, **_too many managers_** still make **_decisions based on "gut instinct"_**, not in **_information_**.

## Some Definitions

> "Ability to **understand** the interconnection of present events as a **means of discovering guides** that allow us to reach future goals, which means improving our ability to make **predictive** judgments for success in **decision making**."  
> [Hans Peter Luhn, 1958]

> "Set of **strategies and tools** focused on **knowledge** administration and creation, through the **data analysis** existing in an organization or company."  
> [Howard Dresner (Gartner Group), 1989] 

> "Ability to **transform data into information, and information into knowledge**, so that the **decision-making** process in business can be optimized."  
> [Guillermina Luz Mora, 2007]  

> "BI uses **data from yesterday and today to make the best decisions** about **tomorrow**."  
> [Scheps, 2008]

> "**BI tools can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to** help identify, develop, and otherwise **create new strategic business opportunities**. They aim to **allow for the easy interpretation of these big data**. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability, and help them take strategic decisions.   
**Business intelligence can be used** by enterprises **to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic**. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions involve priorities, goals, and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data."

## Analytics and Hierarchy of Knowledge Levels

<p><br></p>

- **_Descriptive Analytics_**: **_Describes what happened in a certain period_**. Descriptive analysis is used when the organization has a large set of data about past events or historical events. For this data to be useful, it must be simplified and summarized so that it is understandable to the audience to whom you want to communicate. ([Viquipèdia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%C3%A0lisi_de_dades#An%C3%A0lisi_descriptiva)).  

- **_Diagnostic Analytics_**: It focuses more on the causes of something specific, when evaluating descriptive data, diagnostic analysis tools will help analysts gain insights (identifying patterns and relationships) to solve the root problem. ([Viquipèdia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%C3%A0lisi_de_dades#Anal%C3%ADtica_diagn%C3%B2stica)).

- **_Predictive Analytics_**: It is the application of mathematical and statistical techniques and models to the historical data held by the organization. Although predictive analytics do not attempt to predict the future 100%, because this type of analysis is probabilistic, they do **_predict what could happen_**. ([Viquipèdia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%C3%A0lisi_de_dades#An%C3%A0lisi_predictiva)).

- **_Prescriptive Analytics_**: **_Uses information about what happened, why it happened, and a variety of "possible" situations to help users determine the best action_**. Prescriptive analytics is actually a combination of other analytics models. ([Viquipèdia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%C3%A0lisi_de_dades#An%C3%A0lisi_prescriptiva)).

# Some of the worst practices in Business Intelligence

1. **Not ensuring adequate training for all those involved**
   - Failing to provide proper training can lead to inefficiencies and mistakes in BI processes.

2. **Ill-defined objectives in the planning phase**
   - Lack of clear objectives can result in directionless BI projects and wasted resources.

3. **Using technology that does not satisfy the company's requirements (ETL, DWH, etc.)**
   - Choosing the wrong technology can hinder data processing and analysis.

4. **Underestimating data preparation**
   - Neglecting data preparation can lead to inaccurate insights and reports.

5. **Neglecting good data integration (Excel, ERP, CRM, etc.)**
   - Integrating data sources poorly can result in disjointed information.

6. **Poor data quality**
   - Low-quality data can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

7. **Prioritizing the front-end and defining the delivery time based on it**
   - Focusing solely on the front-end can neglect crucial back-end processes.

8. **Insufficient data protection**
   - Failing to protect data can result in security breaches and compliance issues.

9. **Not knowing how to define the end user (they should always be stakeholders, but they should also be decision-makers)**
   - Understanding the end user's role is essential for effective BI.

10. **Promoting self-service as a solution for all users**
    - Self-service BI may not be suitable for all users and can lead to confusion.

11. **Dependence on Managers and Directors to make information operational**
    - Relying solely on higher-ups can slow down decision-making processes.

12. **Ignoring important data sources or complementary aata that does not exist in the original data source**
    - Overlooking critical data sources can result in incomplete insights.

13. **Lack of knowledge in Data Modeling**
    - Inadequate data modeling can hinder data analysis and interpretation.

14. **Considering, by default, a real-time solution**
    - Not all situations require real-time data, and this can be resource-intensive.

15. **Organizational culture cannot define the solution because it May prevent discoveries in information**
    - A rigid culture can stifle innovation and limit the potential of BI.

16. **Bureaucratic processes can work against BI implementation in large organizations**
    - Excessive bureaucracy can slow down BI projects and hinder agility.

17. **Considering BI projects as simple (leading to poor perception)**
    - Underestimating the complexity of BI projects can lead to unrealistic expectations.

18. **Inaccurate estimates due to inadequate training**
    - Lack of training can result in inaccurate project timelines and budgets.

19. **Not understanding the scope of BI or business rules**
    - Failing to grasp the scope and rules can lead to misaligned BI efforts.

20. **Failure to consider BI as the endpoint of a data pipeline**
    - Neglecting the role of BI as the final stage in data processing can lead to incomplete insights.
